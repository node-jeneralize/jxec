# Jxec

> jxec -> js + exec

## Why

This package is [spawn](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_processspawncommand-args-options) wrapper for:

- Promise interface.
- PID manage.

And this is developed with the policy that:

- Write with TypeScript.
- Compile to CommonJS.

TypeScript is more friendly than pure JavaScript for developers.

CommonJS package can be run directly in the Jest context.

## Install

```
npm install jxec
```

```
yarn add jxec
```
